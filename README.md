# Deep Learning notebooks

This repository contains three Python notebooks serving as guidelines for the implementation in TensorFlow - Keras of the following deep learning architectures:
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for sentiment analysis ([![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GitiHubi/courseACA/blob/main/lab05/aca_colab05.ipynb))
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks
  - Bidirectional LSTM network
  - Dropout Layer and other tecniques to reduce overfitting
- Autoencoders (AE)
  - The relationship between shallow linear AE and the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  - Shallow/deep non-linear AE for hand-written digit recognition
  - Denoising AE
  - AE for sequences (sentiment analysis task)
- Variational Autoencoders (VAE) on hand-written digits
  - The reparametrization trick
  - Data generation using the decoder
  - Visualization of the VAE's latent space

The notebooks also contain very useful insights about the implementation and the mentioned architectures.
