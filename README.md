# Deep Learning notebooks

This repository contains three Python notebooks serving as guidelines for the implementation in TensorFlow - Keras of the following deep learning architectures:
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Autoencoders
- Variational Autoencoders

The notebooks also contain very useful insights about the implementation and the mentioned architectures.

# Recurrent Neural Networks

# Autoencoders

# Variational Autoencoders
